# fits
C fitsio library: pre-compiled binaries for Windows 10 in 32 bit and 64 version.

Simply copy the files into your program directory,
include them via #include "fitsio.h",
and compile it via gcc your_program.c -L. -lcfitsio

If you get a linker error you have most likely chosen the wrong version (32 or 64 bit).
